    XML configuration

    You can open TCP/IP interfaces on several ports or on
    on a specific port or on every interface of the computer
    Default 9598 will listen on all interfaces while
    "127.0.0.1:9598" only will listen on the specified interface.
    To specify several interfaces just enter them with a space
    between them.
    
    interface             - Set port and interface to listen on as a comma
                            separated list.
    encryption            - Set VSCP AES encryption for interface. aes128, ase192, 
                            aes256 are valid values.
    ssl_certificate       - Path to SSL certificat PEM format file. If empty the
                            TLS system will not be initialised.
                            Common path: /etc/vscp/certs/server.pem 
    ssl_certificate_chain - Path to an SSL certificate chain file. As a default, 
                            the ssl_certificate file is used.
    ssl_verify_peer       - [yes/no] Enable clients certificate verification by the 
                            server. Default: no
    ssl_ca_path           - Name of a directory containing trusted CA certificates. 
                            Each file in the directory must contain only a single 
                            CA certificate. The files must be named by the subject 
                            name’s hash and an extension of “.0”. If there is more 
                            than one certificate with the same subject name they 
                            should have extensions ".0", ".1", ".2" and so on 
                            respectively.
    ssl_ca_file           - Path to a .pem file containing trusted certificates. 
                            The file may contain more than one certificate.
    ssl_verify_depth      - Sets maximum depth of certificate chain. If clients certificate 
                            chain is longer than the depth set here connection is refused.
                            Default: 9
    ssl_default_verify_paths - [yes/no] Loads default trusted certificates locations set at 
                                openssl compile time. Default is yes
    ssl_cipher_list       - List of ciphers to present to the client. 
                            Entries should be separated by colons, commas or spaces.
                            
                            Example:
                            ALL           All available ciphers
                            ALL:!eNULL    All ciphers excluding NULL ciphers
                            AES128:!MD5   AES 128 with digests other than MD5
                            
                            See https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/man1/ciphers.html
                            in OpenSSL documentation for full list of options and additional 
                            examples.
    ssl_protocol_version  - Sets the minimal accepted version of SSL/TLS protocol according to 
                            the table:

                            SSL2+SSL3+TLS1.0+TLS1.1+TLS1.2 	0 (default)
                            SSL3+TLS1.0+TLS1.1+TLS1.2 	1
                            TLS1.0+TLS1.1+TLS1.2 	        2
                            TLS1.1+TLS1.2 	                3
                            TLS1.2 	                        4

                            More recent versions of OpenSSL include support for TLS version 1.3. 
                            To use TLS1.3 only, set ssl_protocol_version to 5.
    ssl_short_trust       - [yes/no] Enables the use of short lived certificates. This will allow for the 
                            certificates and keys specified in ssl_certificate, ssl_ca_file and 
                            ssl_ca_path to be exchanged and reloaded while the server is running.

                            In an automated environment it is advised to first write the new pem file 
                            to a different filename and then to rename it to the configured pem file 
                            name to increase performance while swapping the certificate.

                            Disk IO performance can be improved when keeping the certificates and keys 
                            stored on a tmpfs (linux) on a system with very high throughput.  

                            Default: no
